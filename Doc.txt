Task Description: Create a Real-Time Collaborative Bidding Engine

User Types:
1. Bid Creators
2. Bidders

Use Cases:

For Bid Creators:
1. Create a bid with a title and one or more BID_ITEMS (with descriptions) under a single bidding request.
2. Invite BIDDERS to participate in the bid.
3. Set the Start and End times for the BID.
4. PUBLISH the bid, which will send invites to bidders and instantiate the BID.
5. MONITOR all BIDS with a real-time leaderboard of PARTICIPANTS.
6. After the bidding ends, view a Bid Summary with information on all participants' bids.

For Bidders:
1. ACCEPT or REJECT bid requests.
2. Once accepted, place amounts on the items in the Bid Request.
3. View their current rank (in real-time) in the bid.
4. Update their bid amounts any number of times before the BID closes to improve their rank if necessary.
